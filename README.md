In most of my dev life, like most other people, I had contributed mostly on private repositories. That's why you can't see all of my contributions I have done in these years. Recently I decided to contribute more to the public and open-source projects and hopefully you'll see more codes in this profile soon.

- ðŸŒ± Learning advanced practices of Flutter, and very much interested to contribute in some embedded system projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **a Flutter project**

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **some open-source react.js projects**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **javascript, react.js, next.js, redux.js, vue.js, node.js, css3, html5**

- ðŸ“« Recently I planned and started to write some blogs and tutorials for devs. You can find it here - [https://dev.to/bonnopc](https://dev.to/bonnopc).

- âš¡ Fun fact: Earth is round and dark themes should all over the town... ðŸ˜„
